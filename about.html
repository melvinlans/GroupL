                            <p>Growing up in Sierra Leone we saw the desperate need for quality healthcare for people outside major towns and have dedicated our lives to helping improve the lives of these people. The mission has been to become trained in
                                the medical field. Since earning her LPN, RN, BSN, Linda is a Healthcare professional with 8 years of experience working in the Nursing field in Pediatrics, medical-surgical, Rehabilitation, Geriatric care, and Hospice
                                care. Also, she is an instructor for CPR/First Aid (BLS with the American Heart Association)..</p>
                            <p>You can help us and the people of Sierra Leone West Africa, by posting our medical center project on social media, donating clothes, furniture or any type of used medical equipment including walkers, wheelchairs, hospital beds,
                                blankets or anything you think we may need. With the help of loving and compassionate people, we will not only achieve or dream of building this first medical clinic but also many other clinics in Sierra Leone and other
                                parts of Africa as we network our skills and abilities with others trying to do the same thing. Together we are stronger, and together as a global family, we can all make a difference to providing loving care to the people
                                of Sierra Leone.</p>
